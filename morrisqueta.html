		                            Morisqueta, also known as rice, beans, sour cream, cheese, meat and whatever else you can add* is perhaps one of the easiest fixer uppers for a lunch, dinner or for any occasion. Traditionally Morisqueta comes from the south-western part of Mexico. This meal is good on a hot day, cold day, sick day, it honestly doesn’t matter. If you’re hispanic or Mexican, you have probably gotten fed this thousands of times, yet in never gets old, and honestly only gets better the more you have it.

		                        <p>I enjoy making big batches as it’s easy to make, can feed a lot of people and is a perfect meal for meal prepping thats actually somewhat healthy. Alright, enough of me talking this is what you’ll need to get started:<br><br>• Mayocoba Beans (frijoles pintos/frijoles peruanos)<br>• 4 Garlic Cloves or 1 Garlic Bulb<br>• 1 Onion / 1 Cebolla<br>• 1 1b of shredded beef<br>• 1-2 serrano peppers<br>• 1 cilantro bushel<br>• 1 Tomato<br>• 1 cup of White Rice<br><br>Making the beans is what takes the longest, but its also the most rewarding. Mayocoba beans are literally delicious with anything, and filled with fibers and nutrients that will keep you full for longer. I’m a volume eater, so this food is key to avoiding sweets and unnecessary processed food for me.<br><br>Maycoba Beans are also known as frijoles pintos or even frijoles peruanos (Peruvian beans). Before getting to cooking you’ll need to prep which will take around 15 minutes at most. The prep is as follows:<br><br>Begin cooking your rice on a rice cooker<br>Wash 1 1b of beans and place them in a soup container. Add a Liter of water, place them in a large pot that allows room for boiling.<br>Mince 3 garlic cloves<br></p>
		                        <blockquote>Who said simplicity can’t be delicious?<br></blockquote>
		                        <p>Cut a 1/4 of the onions and slice it further into medium chunks (thin 2-3 inches)<br>First and easiest is cooking your rice. I hope you’re using a rice cooker as we’re in the 21st century and it is absolutely the easiest and most delicious way to consume rice. A rice cooker should have your 1 cup of rice ready in 40 – 45 minutes and doesn’t require any additional work. On to the beans! First you’re going to want to wash your beans and place them in a liter of water, add the 3 minced garlic cloves and then the chopped onion pieces. While you wait for the beans to cook and boil you can prep your meat and additional ingredients.<br><br>Get the 1 pound of meat ready, make sure its thawed if you bought it in the frozen isle. Mince 1 additional garlic clove, chop one to two serrano peppers depending on your spice tolerance, one usually gives it a good flavor and a tiny kick! Additionally, chop 1/5 of your cilantro bushel as well and half of your tomato into tiny squares as if you were making salsa. At this point you can begin cooking your meat which should take a couple of minutes, once the beef is cooked, add the tomato, onions, chile serrano, cilantro and mix. Add salt to your liking and thats it!<br><br>The beans are probably ready by now, so lets check on them! Once the beans begin to boil, test them and make sure they’re warm and bland. Once they’re, you’ll know they’re ready. IMPORTANT* Add the salt to the beans after they have been cooked, if you do it before, it won’t have the same effect, and it will taste completely different. At this point, whalllaaa!!! you have made traditional morisqueta. All you need to add is sour cream (my favorites are from local Mexican food places), fresh cheese or dried cheese. In Mexico fresh cheese has a similar texture to ricotta, its delicious, but has significantly less lactose as far as I know. Dried cheese also known as “queso seco” is perfect for morisqueta. Although its hard in texture, with the warm rice, beans and meat it warms up and becomes a perfect addition to the moriqueta.<br><br>Thats it! Please share this recipe if you enjoy it, and let me know if there is any ways to improve it. <br>Thanks for stopping by and happy <i>cooking</i>!<br></p>
